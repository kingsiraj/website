      <h1>What Is Climate Change ?</h1>
      
      <p>Climate change is one of the major challenges of our time. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. </p>
      
      <p>Climate change affects human health and wellbeing through more extreme weather events and wildfires, decreased air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects, food, and water. I feel that climate change needs to be addressed now because if not addressed it could lead to water and food scarcity and countries with food and water scarcity will suffer even more.</p>
